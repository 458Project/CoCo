Phase 2 Documentation

Team Members : Clara Fu, Parv Mital, Johan Cornelissen, Mitchell Waite
Group: cisc458n

Johan: Updated parser.ssl and parser.pt (using parser.def) with new output tokens emitted by the scanner (in scan.ssl) and removed old input tokens. Ensured that scan.ssl and parser.ssl matched.

Johan: Replaced the old PT parser case statements sCaseStmt, sCaseEnd with new Quby select statements sSelStmt, and sSelEnd (in parser.ss;).

Johan: Replaced the old PT parser loops output tokens sWhileStmt, sRepeatStmt, and sRepeatEnd with the new Quby loop statement tokens sRepStmt and SRepOnBreak.
This was in the output tokens section of parser.ssl.

Johan: Added new parser output tokens sModule, sPublic and sSubstring and sLen.
Work was done in output tokens section of parser.ssl.

Johan: Modified the parsing of programs in Quby to accept "ext" and not accept "program". Work was done in @Program rule, by replacing expectation for 'program' with 'ext' and removing the need for a program name. As well ensured no semi colon is needed at end of the line. (Work done in parser.ssl)
   * Work done in @BeginStmt rule to allow multiple statements (after declarations are complete) until end of file. This is done by proceeding to look for more statements as long as there is a new line character. .sBegin and .sEnd token emitted as appropriate. 

Johan: Modified @Block rule in parser.ssl to accept new declarations format for con (from previous const), typ (from previous type), and var. 
   * Block rule no longer requires 'begin' keyword.
   * Removed ability to gave multiple constant declarations under a single "con" keyword.    This was in @ConstantDefinitions rule of parser.ssl
   * In @ConstantValue rule, removed expectation for semicolon after declaration.
   * In @TypeDefinitions rule, removed ability to gave multiple type declarations under a single "typ" keyword. Also rule modified to use ":" instead of "=".
   * In @VariableDeclarations rule, removed ability to gave multiple variable declarations under a single "var" keyword. Also removed expectation for semicolon.
   * Changed @AssignmentOrCallStmt to use "=" instead of ":=". There is more work to be done here.
   
Johan: NOTE, several lines in parser.ssl were commented out for the time being to allow for testing, in the end all the commented sections should be adjusted for quby. Example, if statements, loops etc.

Clara: Modified parser.ssl in order to add Quby functionality for procedures. Added the option to make the procedure public using the 'pub' keyword and have procedures
end with 'end'. Multiple parameters into a procedure is separated by commas instead of semicolons. Added only quby tests.

UPDATE DOCUMENTATION FOR PHASE 2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
############################################################

The goal of these modifications is to convert the Screener/Scanner of the PT Pascal compiler into the Screener/Scanner for Quby. A
detailed listing of all the changes made are listed below:

1. Keywords and Predefined Identifiers
   The keywords and predefined identifiers that were supported by the PT Pascal compiler but not by Quby were removed and new keywords/
   predefined identifiers that are supported by Quby were added. The following changes were made in order to achieve this goal:
   - Removed old PT keywords (then, until, do, program, const, type, procedure, begin, repeat, case, while) from the Language Keywords
     section in the parser/stdIdentifiers file.
   - Added new Quby keywords (ext, con, typ, def, pub, elif, sel, is, rep, on, break, len) to the Language Keywords section of the
     parser/stdIdentifiers file.
   - Replaced the old PT predefined identifiers (char, write, written, read and readln) with the new corresponding Quby predefined
     identifiers (string, print, nl, get, getnl) in the parser/stdIdentifiers file.
   - Updated the value of numberStdIdentifiers to 44 in the parser/parser.pt file.

2. Character Classes and Comments
   Quby supports new input character hash "#" and bang '!' and PT Pascal used "{}" and "(**)" for comments, which will be replaced by
   Quby style comments using the hash character until the end of the line. The following changes were made in order to achieve this goal:
   - Added lHash and lBang (with their recongnized characters # and !) to the input characters and pBang to the output characters in
     the scan.ssl file.
   - The left brace character "{" label was removed and Hash "#" and bang "!" were added as labels to the Scan rule in scan.ssl in
     order to have the scanner recognize these characters.
     The action for a hash character input calls the Comment rule and the action for the bang character emits a pBang output token.
   - The Comment rule in scan.ssl was modified to remove the label/if for a right brace and an exit from loop action was added to the
     actions for the lNewLine label.
   - AlternateComments using "(*" is not supported in Quby so in the Scan rule in the scan.ssl file, the choice action (case/if between
     "*" and any other character) in the left paranthesis "(" label was removed and replace with emitting output token pLeftParen. The
     AlternateComments rule was also removed from the scan.ssl file.
   - The parser.pt file was modified so that the input and output tokens match the ones in scan.def (since hash and bang input and bang
     output characters were added) and the hash and bang characters were added to the character class map (charClassMap).

3. Syntax Tokens
   The syntax tokens and symbols that were supported by PT Pascal but not by Quby were removed and the new Quby syntax tokens and
   symbols were added. The following changes were made in order to achieve this goal:
   - The old PT Pascal output tokens (pThen, pUntil, pDo, pProgram, pConst, pType, pProcedure, pBegin, pCase, pWhile, pRepeat)  were
     removed and replaced with the new Quby output tokens (pExt, pCon, pTyp, pDef, pPub, pElif, pSel, pIs, pOn, pBreak, pLen) in the
     Output keyword tokens section in the scan.ssl file. The old PT Pascal non-compound scanner output tokens (pColonEquals) was
     removed and new Quby non-compound scanner output tokens (pPlusEqual, pMinusEqual, pDoubleEqual, pLeftBrace, pRightBrace) was
     added to the Non-compound output tokens section in the scan.ssl file.
   - Within the Scan rule in the scan.ssl file, a label was added for the left brace "{" that emits an output token pLeftBrace and a
     label was added for the right brace "{" that emits an output token pRightBrace. The choice action within the actions for the colon
     label ":" was removed and replaced with just emitting the pColon output token (pColonEquals ":=" is not supported by Quby). The
     actions in the labels for equals "=", plus "+", minus "-" and bang "!" were modified to add a choice action with a equals label "=",
     which emits the corresponding output token (pDoubleEqual, pPlusEqual, pMinusEqual, pNotEqual), and the any other character * label
     that emits the corresponding character output token (pEquals, pPlus, pMinus, pBang).
   - The parser.pt file was modified so that the output tokens match the ones in scan.def (since many syntax tokens and symbols were
     removed and added to the scan.ssl file).

4. String Literals
   The scanning and screening of PT Pascal's single-quoted char literals "'" was replaced with the scanning and screening of Quby's
   double quoted string literals """. The following change was made in order to achieve this goal:
   - In the parser.pt file, the quote value in the misc. section was changed from single quotes '''' to double quotes '"'.
