The goal of these modifications is to convert the Semantic Analyzer of the PT Pascal compiler into the Semantic Analyzer for Quby. A detailed listing of all the changes made are listed below. They follow the order of the checklist provided in the assignment documentation, adjusted where applicable.

1. Input Tokens
   - The semantic analyzer input tokens in semantic.ssl were modified to match the output tokens from the parser
   - The input, error, operational, type tokens were updated in semantic.pt to match the tokens seen in semantic.def

2. T-Codes
   - All char T-codes were replaced with string T-Codes
   - Changed char T-codes in SSL source to use string T-coded
   - Removed rep T-codes
   - Added tCaseElse and tWhileOnBreak
   - Added tConcatenate, tSubstring, tLength, tIndex, tStringEqual

4. StdType
   - Changed stdChar to stdString

7. TypeKind (Incomplete)
   - Changed tpChar to tpString
   - Commented out tpPackedArray
    **** TODO do we need to keep tpPackedArray? ****

8. TrapKind
   - Changed the names of trWriteChar and trReadChar to trWriteString and trReadString
   - Removed redundant trWriteString
