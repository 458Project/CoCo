This set of test cases is used as full comprehensive Quby tests.
Rather than unit tests (like the other test suites), this test suite aims to test integration by using full Quby programs. Each program has varying Quby components/operators/structures being used. The expected output used for these tests are those provided by the professor of the course. These test cases are a good indication of the overall reliability of the Quby compiler.

Tests with Quby Modules included:
mbubblesort.pt
mbust.pt
mprimes.pt
