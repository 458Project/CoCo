This program simulates the game of blackjack.

The dealer plays the compulsory strategy of standing on 17 or better.

The player plays either
  [1] The standard naive strategy of standing on n or better, or
  [2] A simplified version of the strategy described by  E.O.Thorp
      in his book "Beat the Dealer" (Vintage Books, 1966) pp. 20-21.

Input :
  For each shuffle, a player name (character string of <= 20 characters),
  and if (the player name specified is not "E.O.Thorp", the count [n]
  on which the player stands.

If the player name specified is "E.O.Thorp", the player strategy used will be Thorp's.
Otherwise, the player will use the standard stop on count > n strategy.

The program will simulate one complete shuffle of play for each player.
