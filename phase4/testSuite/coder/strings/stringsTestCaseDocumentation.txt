simpleEmptyStringTest.pt
Test case to ensure emtpy strings can be initialized in Quby, and that the proper code is generated.

emptyStringConcat.pt
Test case to see if an empty string is still table to be used in a concatenation.
Empty strings did not exist in PT so adequate testing was required in this area.

simpleEmptyStrLengthTest.pt
This test case confirms that the length of an empty string is 0.

simpleChrTest.pt
Test case to test the Chr operator which takes an integer and returns the ASCII string. 
Print statement output should display "a" if successful.

simpleOrdTest.pt
Similar to the simpleChrTest test case, this test case ensures the Ord operator can be used to convert an ASCII string character 
to an integer value.

ordTestLongString.txt
This test ensures that if the ord operator is provided a string longer than one character, the operation is only performed on the first character of the string.

simpleStringConcatTest.pt
Test case to ensure two strings can be concatenated to form one larger new string variable.

simpleStringEqualTest.pt
Test case to ensure Quby is able to accurately determine if two strings are equal (the same).

simpleStringSubscriptTest.pt
This test ensures an array of strings can be declared, intialized and accessed appropriately.
A print statement is used to ensure the accessed element is that of which it was initialized.

simpleStringTest.pt
Basic test to ensure Quby's new strings (instead of character arrays) can be declared and initialized.

simpleStrLengthTest.pt
Test case to ensure the length operator functions accurately on a non-zero length string.

simpleSubstringTest.pt
Test used to test Quby's new substring operator. A print statement is used to confirm a subset of the string was captured.

stringParameterByRefInRoutine.pt
Due to the addition of strings, Quby now allows strings to be passed to routines.
This test ensures routines can accept strings by reference using "var" in the parameter list.

stringParameterInRoutineQuby.pt
Similarly, due to the addition of strings, this test ensures Quby now allows strings to be passed to routines by value.

stringMultipleParametersInRoutineQuby.pt
Test case used to ensure that a routine can accept multiple string parameters.

For all tests, see expectedOutputFiles directory for expected outputs.
