qubyIfStmt.pt
Quby test case to ensure the modified Quby parser can successfully parse a simple if-statement without an elif or else block.
The input test code is in the form of:
if expression :
  statement
end

qubyIfElifStmt.pt
Test case to ensure Quby's parser is successful in outputting the appropriate semantic tokens for a complete if-elif block (note the omission of an else block).
The input test code is in the form of:
if expression :
  statement
elif expression :
  statement
end

qubyIfElseStmt.pt
Test case to ensure the traditional simple if-else block is still valid using the Quby parser (note the omission of an elif block).
The input test code is in the form of:
if expression :
  statement
else:
  statement
end

qubyIfElifElseStmt.pt
Test case to ensure Quby's parser is successful in outputting the appropriate semantic tokens for a complete if-elif-else block.
The input test code is in the form of:
if expression :
  statement
elif expression :
  statement
else :
  statement
end

qubyIfMultiElifStmt.pt
Test case to ensure Quby's parser is successful in outputting the appropriate semantic tokens for a complete if-elif-elif block (note the omission of an else block and inclusion of multiple elif blocks).
The input test code is in the form of:
if expression :
  statement
elif expression :
  statement
elif expression :
  statement
end

qubyIfMultiElifMultiStmt.pt
Test case to ensure Quby's parser is successful in outputting the appropriate semantic tokens for a complete if-elif-elif block (note the omission of an else block) with *multiple* statements inside of each code block.
The input test code is in the form of:
if expression :
  statement
  statement
elif expression :
  statement
  statement
elif expression :
  statement
  statement
